Aptitude Assignment 3:-
===========================

1. Write two quadratic equations such that the sum of roots equals twice the
product of roots?

Ans.One possible pair of quadratic equations that meet this condition are:

x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0
x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0

The sum of the roots of the first equation is equal to -2, and the product of the roots is 1. The sum of the roots of the second equation is equal to 2, and the product of the roots is 1.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of both equations is equal to 2 * (-2) + 2 * 2 = 0, and the product of the roots is 1 * 1 = 1.


2. 2x+3y=12 has (2,3) as its solution or not?

Ans. Yes, (2,3) is a solution to the equation 2x + 3y = 12.

To verify, we can plug in the values x = 2 and y = 3 into the equation and see if both sides of the equation are equal.

On the left side:
2 * 2 + 3 * 3 = 4 + 9 = 13

On the right side:
12

Since the left side is not equal to the right side, (2,3) is not a solution to the equation 2x + 3y = 12.


3. Find possible coordinates of (x,y) such that point (1,1), (2,2) & (x,y) are collinear?

Ans.For three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) to be collinear, the slope between each pair of points must be equal.

Let's consider the slope between points (1,1) and (2,2), which is:
m = (2-1)/(2-1) = 1

The slope between points (2,2) and (x,y) is:
m = (y-2)/(x-2) = 1

So, we can write the equation based on this slope:
y-2 = (y-2)/(x-2) * (x-2) = x-2

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
y = x

Therefore, any point that lies on the line y = x would be collinear with points (1,1) and (2,2).

4. Find out all possible values of a & b for which the ratio of a^3+b^3 to a^3-b^3 is 1:1
a,b are real numbers.

Ans.For the ratio of a^3 + b^3 to a^3 - b^3 to be 1:1, the following condition must be satisfied:
(a^3 + b^3) / (a^3 - b^3) = 1

Expanding the expression on both sides:
(a^3 + b^3) / (a^3 - b^3) = (a^3 + b^3) / (a^3 - b^3) = 1

Multiplying both sides by (a^3 - b^3):
a^3 + b^3 = a^3 - b^3

Expanding the equation:
2a^3 = 2b^3

Dividing both sides by 2:
a^3 = b^3

Taking the cube root of both sides:
a = b

Therefore, the only possible values of a and b that satisfy the condition are a = b, where a and b are real numbers.

5. The triangle area formed by the lines y=x, y-axis and y=3 line will be?
Ans.  The triangle can be formed by finding the intersection of the lines y=x, y=3 and the y-axis.

The y-axis has equation x=0, so when x=0, y=0.

At y=x, x=y. So when y=3, x=3.

Therefore, the three points that form the triangle are (0,0), (3,3) and (0,3).

To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:
Area = (1/2) * base * height

The base of the triangle is 3 units and the height is 3 units.

Therefore, the area of the triangle is:
Area = (1/2) * 3 * 3 = 4.5 square units.
